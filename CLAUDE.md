## Workflow Rules
1. For each new feature, bug fix, or refactor:
   - DISCUSS and BRAINSTORM the approach
   - ALIGN on implementation strategy
   - Get explicit approval before coding
2. When starting development servers (frontend or backend):
   - Tell the user and they will start it in their own terminal instance
